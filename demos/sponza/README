This demo requires the Sponza model (included in the repository) and the
Sponza texture pack (not included). Use the 'download-textures.sh' script
to download and unpack the textures before running the demo.

Known issues:
---------------------------------

* There is a clipping bug that makes the entire model to be clipped when
  a small part of it should still visible. This can happen when the camera
  is high up close to the ceiling and looking up.
