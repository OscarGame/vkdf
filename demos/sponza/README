This demo requires the Sponza model (included in the repository) and the
Sponza texture pack (not included). Use the 'download-textures.sh' script
to download and unpack the textures before running the demo.

Known issues:
---------------------------------

* There is a clipping bug that makes the entire model suddenly disappear when
  a small part of it should still be visible. This can happen when the camera
  is high up close to the ceiling and looking up. The same clipping bug
  affects shadow mapping and can be observed in the same scenario, but it
  usually happens a bit earlier than the model clipping bug, so it is possible
  to see the shadows vanish before we move high up enough for the entire model
  to disappear.
