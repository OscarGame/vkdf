This demo requires the Sponza model (included in the repository) and the
Sponza texture pack (not included). Use the 'download-textures.sh' script
to download and unpack the textures before running the demo.

Known issues:
---------------------------------

* There is a clipping bug that make the entire model to be clipped when
  it is still visible. This can happen when the camera is high up close
  to the ceiling and looking up.

* There are several performance improvements that can be made. Specifically,
  the scene renderer can only clip full objects and not individual meshes
  inside a given object. Since we only have one object with the full model,
  we are rendering all the meshes in each frame. We could improve this by
  creating a separate object for each mesh in the model, adding support for
  mesh-level clipping in the scene renderer or by marking the object as
  dynamic and do clipping in the demo app at each frame.
